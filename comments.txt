package.json:
	"dependencies": {
			"express": "3.4.2",
			"ejs": "*",
			"commander": "*",
			"async": "*",
			"request": "2.27.0",
			"js-base64": "2.1.2"

	number (ex: "3.4.2") - number of version (you can find it from: node_modules -> <package> -> package.json -> version)
	"*" 				 - this means that all versions will do and the latest will be installed while installing..

	npm shrinkwrap 		 - makes the the file with installed versions. use this when you want to fix the versions

	if you plan to continue developing the application - use the "*" in dependencies
	if no further development is planned - use the specific versions
